# Kube Node Ready Controller Configuration
# Example configuration without CPU limits (recommended for loaded clusters)
# This demonstrates that resource limits are optional

# Worker Pod Configuration
worker:
  # Container image configuration
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/kube-node-ready
    tag: latest
    pullPolicy: Never # IfNotPresent

  # Optional: Service account for worker pods (defaults to namespace default)
  serviceAccountName: "kube-node-ready-worker"

  # Priority class for worker pods
  priorityClassName: system-node-critical

  # Resource requests and limits for worker pods
  # Note: CPU limits are not set - this is recommended for loaded clusters
  # to avoid CPU throttling during checks
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "50m"
      memory: "64Mi"
    limits:
      # cpu: ""  # No CPU limit - allows bursting when needed
      memory: "128Mi"  # Memory limit still recommended to prevent OOM

  # ConfigMap name containing worker runtime configuration
  configMapName: kube-node-ready-worker

  # Job Configuration (optional - provides better reliability and auto-retry)
  job:
    # Job timeout
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 300
    # Number of retries for failed pods (Kubernetes handles this automatically)
    backoffLimit: 2
    # Number of successful completions required
    completions: 1
    # Auto-cleanup completed jobs after specified seconds (optional)
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600

# Reconciliation Configuration
reconciliation:
  intervalSeconds: 10
  maxRetries: 5
  retryBackoff: linear # exponential

# Node Management Configuration
nodeManagement:
  deleteFailedNodes: false
  taints: []
  #  - key: node-ready/unverified
  #    value: "true"
  #    effect: NoSchedule
  verifiedLabel:
